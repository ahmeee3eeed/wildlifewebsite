          <h2>Indigenous animals of Sri Lanka</h2>
          <h3>What does it mean?</h3>
          <p>An indigenous species, also known as a native species, is an organism that lives 
            and evolves naturally in a specific geographic region without the intervention or 
            introduction of humans. These species have adapted to the local climatic conditions, 
            climate, and ecosystems of the region where they originated. Indigenous species have 
            existed in a certain region's environment for a long time, and their presence is due 
            to natural processes such as evolution, migration, and ecological interactions.</p>

          <p>
            Indigenous species and habitats must be preserved and protected in order to conserve 
            biodiversity and manage ecosystems. Conservation initiatives frequently focus on maintaining 
            ecological integrity by addressing concerns such as habitat loss, pollution, climate change, 
            and the introduction of exotic species.
